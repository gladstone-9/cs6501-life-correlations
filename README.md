# Stress Impacts On Lifestyle Behavior

## Overview
This study explores the relationship between work-related stress and daily lifestyle behavior. Using long-term online behavioral data from a single participant, the research examines how stress affects sleep, fitness, and gaming habits. The findings indicate that work-related stress has a statistically significant but small negative impact on a person’s lifestyle choices.

## Introduction
Stress has been extensively studied for its effects on social and physiological behavior. This study aims to answer:
- **RQ1**: How does an individual allocate time under no stress?
- **RQ2**: How does stress influence an individual's lifestyle over an extended period?

By analyzing long-term online activity data, this study provides insight into how academic stress affects daily habits.

## Methodology

### Study Design
The study is based on self-collected data from the author, capturing behavioral patterns over multiple years. Workload and overlapping deadlines serve as proxies for stress.

### Data Collection
Data sources include:
- **School Work**: Canvas and Gradescope logs
- **Fitness**: iPhone Health data (steps, active/basal burn)
- **Social Media & Gaming**: Riot Games and Screen Time analytics
- **Sleep**: Browser search history and Google Location Timeline

### Statistical Analysis
The study employs:
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)** to measure relationships between stress and lifestyle variables.
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression** to explore causality.

## Results

### Correlation Findings
Work-related stress exhibits weak negative correlations with lifestyle activities:
- **Sleep**: \(r = -0.13\), \(p = 0.5\)
- **Steps per day**: \(r = -0.14\), \(p < 0.001\)
- **Active Burn**: \(r = -0.19\), \(p < 0.001\)
- **Basal Burn**: \(r = -0.10\), \(p < 0.05\)
- **Gaming**: \(r = -0.20\), \(p \approx 0.05\)

### Causation Analysis
OLS regression indicates that stress is a statistically significant but weak predictor of reduced physical activity and gaming.

## Future Work
Potential improvements include:
- Expanding stress measurement to include grades and external factors.
- Applying non-linear models for deeper behavioral insights.
- Incorporating social media and qualitative self-assessments.

## Ethical Considerations
This study anonymized sensitive data and obtained consent from the participant. No mental health diagnoses were inferred.
